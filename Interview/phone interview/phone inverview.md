I really enjoy collaborative environments.  
I always make sure I deliver my own tasks reliably, but I also try to contribute beyond my scope — whether that’s improving testing practices, suggesting architectural improvements, or helping refine sprint planning.

For example, in my current role, I helped restructure part of the codebase and introduced better testing patterns, which improved onboarding speed and reduced regression issues.

I believe strong teams are built on clear communication and shared ownership.
